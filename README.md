# MYNTRA-CLONE - created by Satyajit Parida
I created a frontend clone of Myntra using HTML and CSS, replicating the popular e-commerce platform’s sleek and responsive design. 
The project includes a well-structured homepage, a navigation bar, product listing sections, and a visually appealing layout. It features a responsive design, ensuring smooth adaptability across different screen sizes. CSS was extensively used to style elements, maintain a clean UI, and enhance user experience. This project helped me improve my front-end development skills, focusing on layout structuring, styling, and responsiveness. It serves as a great demonstration of my ability to recreate modern web interfaces with precision and efficiency.
